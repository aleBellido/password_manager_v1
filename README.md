# 🛠️ Password Manager (Early Version)

Welcome to my first attempt at building a **Password Manager**!  
This is a very early-stage project and **not production-ready**.  
The main goal for now is to practice and improve my skills in:

- Python 🐍  
- Git & GitHub 🧠  
- Project structure & organization 💼  
- (Eventually) Security & encryption 🔐

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- [x] Project initialized  
- [x] First basic script working  
- [ ] Decent interface  
- [ ] Secure password encryption  
- [ ] Persistent storage  
- [ ] Unit testing  
- [ ] Polished CLI or GUI  

---

## ⚠️ Warning

**Do NOT use this to store real passwords.**  
There is currently no encryption or proper security implemented.

---

## 💡 Purpose

Gradually improve this password manager as I learn and grow as a developer.  
Feedback, suggestions, or constructive pull requests are always welcome!

## 🔧 Quick Installation (Temporary)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager.git
cd password-manager
python main.py
